# Pi Subagents

**Claude Code-style autonomous sub-agents for Pi agent. Spawn specialized agents in isolated sessions, run them in foreground or background, steer them mid-run, resume completed sessions, and define your own custom agent types.**

## About this repository

This is the **Aether-enabled fork** of [pi-subagents](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents) by the [Aether](https://aether.baimoqilin.com) team. It tracks the upstream project and adds first-class support for running inside Aether, the mobile AI agent built on the Pi Coding Agent core:

- **Aether Script Mod** (`src/aether.ts`) — native mobile UI surfaces including live composer status widgets, conversation viewer overlays, and dedicated settings pages.
- **Native prompt mentions** — `@handle message` prompt mentions routed through Aether's `before_send` hook directly to running or new subagent instances without a main-model turn.
- **Semantic tool titles** — registers human-friendly running and completed titles for `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, and `steer_subagent`.

The upstream project remains the source of truth for subagent execution and Pi-side behavior; this repository layers the Aether UI and runtime integration on top and stays rebased on upstream releases.

## Aether integration

When installed in Aether, this package loads a Script Extension (no Native Mod required). The Script Mod adapts the TUI-facing surfaces to Aether Script API v2:

- **Live agent roster & FleetView**: Persistent, interactive status cards rendered above the composer displaying active subagent progress, turn counters, token usage, and live activity.
- **Conversation viewer overlay**: Full overlay transcript viewer (`app.overlay`) with live auto-refresh, inline steering field, and subagent Stop controls.
- **Native settings & Agent management**: Dual settings pages for runtime options (`.pi/subagents.json`) and agent definition management (enabling, disabling, reloading, and drafting `.pi/agents/*.md`).
- **Prompt mentions**: Typing `@handle message` is intercepted before sending to dispatch directly to subagents without consuming a main-model turn.
- **Styled transcript cards**: Background completions, results, and conversation exports render as native Aether message cards.
- **Semantic tool titles**: Subagent tool invocations display clean status titles via `aether.registerToolTitle`.

Settings and agent definitions stay in full sync with standard Pi files. Script changes hot-reload without restarting Aether.

## Features

- **Claude Code look & feel** — same tool names, calling conventions, and UI patterns (`Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, `steer_subagent`) — feels native
- **Parallel background agents** — spawn multiple agents that run concurrently with automatic queuing (configurable concurrency limit, default 4) and smart group join (consolidated notifications)
- **Live widget UI** — persistent above-editor widget with animated spinners, live tool activity, token counts, and colored status icons. Configurable via `/agents → Settings → Widget`: `all` (every agent), `background` (default — hides foreground runs, which already render inline as the `Agent` tool result), or `off`
- **FleetView** — Claude Code-style navigable list of `main` + every running subagent rendered below the editor (earliest-launched first). Press `↓` (or `←`) at an empty prompt to jump in, `↑`/`↓` to move the selection, `Enter` to open the selected agent's live, auto-updating conversation, `Esc` to return. Finished agents linger briefly before dropping out, and a viewer stays open through completion so you can read the final output. Toggle via `/agents → Settings → Fleet view`
- **Conversation viewer** — select any agent in `/agents` to open a live-scrolling overlay of its full conversation (auto-follows new content, scroll up to pause). Steer a running agent inline by pressing `Enter` to open a composer, typing, then `Enter` to send (`Esc` or an empty submit returns) — the message appears as a user message and redirects the agent after its current tool. Stop a still-running agent by pressing `x` (then `x` again to confirm) — both work for background agents too
- **Custom agent types** — define agents in `.pi/agents/<name>.md` or `.agents/agents/<name>.md` (project) or globally, with YAML frontmatter: custom system prompts, model selection, thinking levels, tool restrictions, and Claude Code-compatible colored name badges
- **Nested subagents** — opt-in, default-off delegation: a custom agent that sets `allowed_subagents` gets its own ownership-scoped `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, and `steer_subagent` tools, depth-capped from the main session (default 2). It can control only its own children, they are stopped when it finishes, and their transcripts and token spend roll up to it. The allowlist is a privilege boundary — a child runs with its own tools, so pick it as carefully as `tools:` itself
- **Agent mentions** — subagents are first-class: type `@explore also check the RPC path` at the prompt and it goes to that agent instead of the main model, without a word of it entering the chat. One syntax covers the whole lifecycle — message it while it runs, resume it once it has finished, reopen its session from disk long after that, or start it if it never ran. Mentioning an agent that isn't running spawns it through an off-screen clone of the conversation, so it gets Claude Code's context-written prompt and a real `Agent` tool call without a word of it reaching the chat; `direct` mode starts it here from your text instead, with no model call at all. The orchestrator can `name` an agent so you address it as `@auth-audit`, and handles work in `steer_subagent`/`get_subagent_result` too. `@` completes live agents, resumable ones, and startable types alongside pi's file completion; `@main` forces text back to the main model. Toggle via `/agents → Settings → Agent mentions`
- **Mid-run steering** — inject messages into running agents to redirect their work without restarting
- **Session resume** — pick up where an agent left off, preserving full conversation context. Resumes in the foreground by default, or pass `run_in_background: true` to resume detached and be notified on completion, just like a background spawn
- **Graceful turn limits** — agents get a "wrap up" warning before hard abort, producing clean partial results instead of cut-off output
- **Case-insensitive agent types** — `"explore"`, `"Explore"`, `"EXPLORE"` all work. A type that doesn't resolve to exactly one *enabled* agent — unknown, disabled, or ambiguous between two agents differing only by case — falls back to general-purpose with a note, or is refused outright under [`fallbackSubagent: none`](#persistent-settings)
- **Fuzzy model selection** — specify models by name (`"haiku"`, `"sonnet"`) instead of full IDs, with automatic filtering to only available/configured models
- **Context inheritance** — optionally fork the parent conversation into a sub-agent so it knows what's been discussed
- **Persistent agent memory** — three scopes (project, local, user) with automatic read-only fallback for agents without write tools
- **Git worktree isolation** — run agents in isolated repo copies; changes auto-committed to branches on completion
- **Skill preloading** — inject named skills into agent system prompts, discovered from `.pi/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, and global locations (Pi-standard `<name>/SKILL.md` directory layout supported)
- **Tool denylist** — block specific tools via `disallowed_tools` frontmatter
- **Styled completion notifications** — background agent results render as themed, compact notification boxes (icon, stats, result preview) instead of raw XML. Expandable to show full output. Group completions render each agent individually
- **Event bus** — lifecycle events (`subagents:created`, `started`, `completed`, `failed`, `steered`, `compacted`) emitted via `pi.events`, enabling other extensions to react to sub-agent activity
- **Cross-extension RPC** — other pi extensions can spawn and stop subagents via the `pi.events` event bus (`subagents:rpc:ping`, `subagents:rpc:spawn`, `subagents:rpc:stop`). Standardized reply envelopes with protocol versioning. Emits `subagents:ready` on session start
- **Schedule subagents** — pass `schedule` to the `Agent` tool to fire on cron / interval / one-shot. Session-scoped jobs with PID-locked persistence; results land via the same `subagent-notification` followUp path as manual background completions; manage via `/agents → Scheduled jobs`
- **Model scope enforcement** — opt-in validation that subagent model choices stay within your pi `enabledModels` allowlist (sourced from `/scoped-models`, with both global and project-local pi settings honored). Caller-supplied out-of-scope → hard error to orchestrator; frontmatter-pinned out-of-scope → warning + runs anyway (frontmatter authoritative). Toggle via `/agents → Settings → Scope models`

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@tintinweb/pi-subagents
```

Or load directly for development:

```bash
pi -e ./src/index.ts
```

### In Aether

Download the release package from the [Releases page](https://github.com/AetherExtensions/pi-subagents/releases) of this repository, then import it in Aether via **Settings → Extensions → Import extension**. The package includes the Pi extension and the Aether Script Mod in one zip; Script updates hot-reload without restarting Aether.

## Quick Start

The parent agent spawns sub-agents using the `Agent` tool:

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  prompt: "Find all files that handle authentication",
  description: "Find auth files",
  run_in_background: true,
})
```

Foreground agents block until complete and return results inline. Background agents return an ID immediately and notify you on completion.

### Scheduling

Add a `schedule` field to register the agent to fire later instead of running now:

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  prompt: "Look at recent commits and summarize what changed since last week",
  description: "Weekly commit review",
  schedule: "0 0 9 * * 1",   // 9am every Monday (6-field cron)
})
```

Schedule formats:

- **Cron** — 6-field (`second minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`), e.g. `"0 0 9 * * 1"` for 9am every Monday, `"0 */15 * * * *"` for every 15 minutes.
- **Interval** — `"5m"`, `"1h"`, `"30s"`, `"2d"`. Fires repeatedly at that interval.
- **One-shot relative** — `"+10m"`, `"+2h"`, `"+1d"`. Fires once at that future time.
- **One-shot absolute** — full ISO timestamp, e.g. `"2026-12-25T09:00:00.000Z"`.

When a schedule fires, the spawn runs in background and its completion notification arrives in the conversation through the same `subagent-notification` followUp path as a manually-spawned background agent — your parent agent reasons about the result the same way.

Schedules are **session-scoped**: they reset on `/new` and restore on `/resume`. List and cancel via `/agents → Scheduled jobs` (creation is the `Agent` tool's job — there is no parallel manual-create wizard). Storage at `<cwd>/.pi/subagent-schedules/<sessionId>.json` with PID-based file locking for cross-instance safety.

**Disable the feature entirely**: `/agents → Settings → Scheduling → disabled` removes `schedule` from the `Agent` tool spec (no LLM-context cost), hides the menu entry, and stops any active scheduler. The schema-level removal takes effect on the next pi session; the runtime kill is immediate. Re-enable from the same menu.

Restrictions:
- `schedule` cannot be combined with `inherit_context` (no parent conversation exists at fire time) or `resume` (schedules create fresh agents).
- `run_in_background: false` is refused — scheduled jobs always run in the background. Omitting it, or passing `true`, is fine.
- Scheduled fires bypass the `maxConcurrent` queue so a 5-minute interval cannot be deferred behind long-running manual agents.
- **Headless `pi -p` doesn't wait for scheduled subagents.**

## UI

The extension renders a persistent widget above the editor showing active agents. By default it shows background runs only (`widgetMode: background`) — foreground agents already render inline as the `Agent` tool result, so the widget would otherwise double-render them. Switch to `all` (every agent) or `off` (hide the widget) via `/agents → Settings → Widget`:

```
● Agents
├─ ⠹ Agent  Refactor auth module · ↻5≤30 · 5 tool uses · 33.8k token (62%) · 12.3s
│    ⎿  editing 2 files…
├─ ⠹ Explore  Find auth files · ↻3 · 3 tool uses · 12.4k token (8%) · 4.1s
│    ⎿  searching…
├─ ⠹ Agent  Long-running task · ↻42 · 38 tool uses · 91.0k token (84% · ⇊2) · 2m17s
│    ⎿  reading…
└─ 2 queued
```

The token field is annotated with two optional signals inside parens:
- **`NN%`** — context-window utilization (color-coded: <70% dim, 70–85% warning, ≥85% error). Omitted when the model has no declared `contextWindow`, or briefly right after compaction.
- **`⇊N`** — number of times the session has compacted, when > 0. Stays dim; the percent's color carries urgency.

### FleetView

While subagents are running, a Claude Code-style navigable list renders **below** the editor:

```
  esc to interrupt · ← for agents · ↓ to manage

  ● main
  ○ general-purpose  Sleep then report 1                                11s · ↓ 13.1k tokens
  ○ general-purpose  Sleep then report 2                                11s · ↓ 13.1k tokens
                                                                                   ↓ 3 more
```

The list is ordered earliest-launched first, and only shows agents you can actually open (pending/queued agents with no session yet appear once they start). At an **empty prompt**, press `↓` (or `←`) to move focus from the prompt into the list — the selected row is marked `●`, the rest `○`. `↑`/`↓` move the selection, `Enter` opens the selected agent's live conversation overlay (it auto-updates as the agent works), and `Esc` (or `↑` above `main`) returns to the prompt. Selecting `main` returns to the normal view. Inside the overlay, press `Enter` to steer the running agent — type a message and `Enter` to send it (`Esc` or an empty submit returns), and it redirects the agent the same way the `steer_subagent` tool does. A viewer stays open when its agent finishes so you can read the final output, and finished agents linger in the list for a few seconds before dropping out. Typing anything at a non-empty prompt behaves normally — the list only captures arrow keys when the prompt is empty. Disable it entirely via `/agents → Settings → Fleet view`.

### Agent mentions

Subagents are addressable. Every agent has a typeable handle — the agent type, lowercased, numbered when instances collide (`explore`, `explore-2`) — and `@handle <message>` at the prompt talks to that agent, whatever state it happens to be in. Type `@` to pick one:

```
❯ @
  @auth-audit     send message · Explore · running · audit the auth flow
  @explore-2      send message · running · find flaky tests
  @code-review    resume · code-review · check the diff
  @plan           start agent · Software architect agent for designing implementation plans.
```

The handle names the **agent**, not one process, so a single syntax covers its whole lifecycle:

| State | `@explore fix the flaky test` does |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| running or queued | sends the message into its conversation, exactly as `steer_subagent` would |
| finished | **resumes** it in the background from its existing session, continuing where it left off |
| finished long ago, record gone | **reopens** its session from disk and continues there |
| never started | **starts** it — by default, through a clone of this conversation ([below](#starting-a-new-agent)) |

No turn is ever spent in the main conversation, and nothing about the mention enters the chat. The answer comes back as the ordinary background-completion notification, so the main model can relay it.

#### Starting a new agent

Claude Code does not start a mentioned agent itself. `@agent-<type>` becomes an *attachment* appending a `<system-reminder>` to your prompt — "the user has expressed a desire to invoke the agent X; please invoke the agent appropriately, passing in the required context to it" — and the main model makes the tool call. There is no tool forcing and no allowed-tools narrowing: the mention constrains *which* agent, not what it is told. So the model writes the agent's prompt, giving it the conversation context a cold spawn lacks.

The cost is a visible turn — the model's reasoning and its tool block, narrating a decision you already made by typing the handle. This extension keeps the mechanism and moves it off-screen. The conversation is copied into a throwaway in-memory session, that clone takes the turn holding only the `Agent` tool, and what it starts is an ordinary top-level agent:

```
@cyan whats your favorite color        →  (nothing in the chat)
  └─ clone of this conversation, off-screen
       └─ Agent(subagent_type: "cyan", prompt: …)
            ▸ Cyan Agent   favorite color        ← widget, fleet row, handle
```

It is a literal clone — the session's own entries and the same system prompt, not [`inherit_context`](#agent-frontmatter)'s text rendering of them — taken from memory and compaction-aware, so what the copy reads is what the main model is working from. The clone gets one tool and one job; it cannot read, write or run anything, because an invisible turn with the full toolset could do invisible work. The agent it starts is attributed to the *real* session, so its transcript and `rootSessionId` land where they would have anyway, and it carries no `tool-use-id` — the main conversation never issued one.

| Mode | `@plan sketch the migration`, with no Plan agent running |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `model` (default) | a clone of this conversation takes the turn off-screen and calls `Agent`, so the agent starts with a prompt **written from the conversation**. Nothing reaches the chat but a `Starting @plan…` toast |
| `direct` | the agent starts here, immediately, with your message verbatim as its prompt. No model call at all, so no latency before it begins |
| `off` | `@` means only "attach a file" again |

Either way the started agent honours its own frontmatter — `model:`, `thinking:`, `max_turns:` all apply, since neither path passes them and the agent's config wins. Mentioning something as the very first thing in a session works: there is simply no history to carry, and the clone still runs on your model and system prompt. If it cannot deliver at all — a model can always answer in prose instead of calling the tool — the agent is started directly with your text and the toast says so, rather than leaving you with nothing running.

`model` is also the only mode that works outside the TUI: `pi -p '@plan the migration'` clones, spawns, and reports through the normal completion path, where a direct start would have detached the agent and printed nothing. Messaging and resuming stay TUI-only for that reason, in both modes.

Two things to weigh against `direct`: the clone re-sends the whole conversation, and the agent does not start until that turn finishes.

**Named agents.** The `Agent` tool takes an optional `name`, so the orchestrator can call one `auth-audit` instead of leaving you to tell `@explore-2` from `@explore-3`. A name is *additive*: the type-derived handle is still assigned, so `@explore` keeps reaching that agent rather than starting a second one beside it. Both names share one namespace — an alias can never shadow a live handle or the reverse — and the popup shows one row per agent, under its alias, with the type moved into the description. `steer_subagent` and `get_subagent_result` accept a handle too, so you and the model address agents the same way.

**Resuming much later.** Because subagent sessions are persisted by default ([`rememberAgents`](#persistent-settings)), a handle keeps working after the agent's in-memory record is evicted: `@explore anything else?` reopens the conversation from disk. Only the *definition* is re-resolved, so a continuation runs under the agent type's current frontmatter, not the one the first run used. If the type has since been deleted or disabled, the resume is refused rather than falling back to another agent — re-enable it and the handle works again. Names from an evicted agent stay reserved, so a later Explore becomes `explore-2` rather than shadowing something you can still reach; the 100 most recent are kept, and all of them are forgotten on `/new` and session switch. A resumed agent takes those names back, so `@explore` keeps meaning the same conversation. An agent whose session was only ever in memory leaves nothing to reopen, and the mention starts a fresh one instead; if the session file has since been deleted, the mention says so and frees the handle rather than silently sending your message to a new agent.

The grammar mirrors Claude Code's, and is deliberately narrow so nothing gets swallowed by accident:

| Input | Goes to |
|-------|---------|
| `@explore fix the flaky test` | the `explore` agent |
| `@agent-explore fix the flaky test` | the same agent — Claude Code's manual spelling, accepted as a synonym |
| `@main @explore is not a mention` | the main model, with `@main ` stripped — the escape hatch |
| `@explore` (no message) | the main model — a bare handle is never a send |
| `hey @explore look at this` | the main model — only a **leading** mention is routed |
| `@src/index.ts summarize this` | the main model, with pi's normal file attachment |
| `@nosuchagent hello` | the main model, verbatim — no agent, no type, no interception |

While an agent is live its handle addresses *it*, so `@explore` never starts a second Explore alongside a running one — use the `Agent` tool for deliberate parallelism. `@<agent-id>` works too. `main` is reserved and can never be an agent's handle (a type slugging to it gets `main-2`); handles are capped at 64 characters. A handle written as typed always wins over the `@agent-` form, so an agent genuinely called `agent-explore` stays reachable. [Nested subagents](#nested-subagents) are not addressable — they are hidden from every top-level surface and only their owner may steer them, so a handle that would name one starts a fresh top-level agent instead of reaching through that boundary. Suggestions list live agents first, then startable types; when an `@` token names an agent, file suggestions are suppressed for it. Disable the whole thing via `/agents → Settings → Agent mentions`.

A `direct`-mode start takes the non-tool spawn path shared with the scheduler and cross-extension RPC, so — like those — it writes no `.output` transcript and the widget shows it without per-tool detail. That is the trade for skipping the model call: a `model`-mode start goes through the real `Agent` tool and keeps everything. A mention-*resumed* agent goes through the full resume wiring and keeps both in either mode.

Individual agent results render Claude Code-style in the conversation:

| State | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Running** | `⠹ ↻3≤30 · 3 tool uses · 12.4k token (8%)` / `⎿ searching, reading 3 files…` |
| **Completed** | `✓ ↻8 · 5 tool uses · 33.8k token (62%) · 12.3s` / `⎿ Done` |
| **Wrapped up** | `✓ ↻50≤50 · 50 tool uses · 89.1k token (84% · ⇊2) · 45.2s` / `⎿ Wrapped up (turn limit)` |
| **Stopped** | `■ ↻3 · 3 tool uses · 12.4k token (8%)` / `⎿ Stopped` |
| **Error** | `✗ ↻3 · 3 tool uses · 12.4k token (8%)` / `⎿ Error: timeout` |
| **Aborted** | `✗ ↻55≤50 · 55 tool uses · 102.3k token (95% · ⇊3)` / `⎿ Aborted (max turns exceeded)` |

Completed results can be expanded (ctrl+o in pi) to show the full agent output inline.

By default, foreground and background agents each stream their full conversation to a per-subagent transcript — a JSON-lines file at `<os-tmpdir>/pi-subagents-<uid>/<cwd>/<session>/tasks/<agent-id>.output` (owner-only `0700`, cleared on reboot). Set `output_transcript: false` on a custom agent to write no transcript path or file for it, or set `outputTranscript: false` in `subagents.json` to make transcripts opt-in for the whole project (frontmatter overrides the project default). This governs **only** the transcript: it is independent of `persist_session` (the pi session on disk), and it does not affect `isolation: worktree` (which commits the agent's work to a git branch) or `memory:` (durable files) — set those accordingly if the goal is to keep a run off disk entirely. Background agent completion notifications render as styled boxes:

```
✓ Find auth files completed
  ↻3 · 3 tool uses · 12.4k token · 4.1s
  ⎿  Found 5 files related to authentication...
  transcript: /tmp/pi-subagents-501/home-user-project/sess-1/tasks/agent-abc123.output
```

Group completions render each agent as a separate block. The LLM receives structured `<task-notification>` XML for parsing, while the user sees the themed visual.

## Default Agent Types

| Type | Tools | Model | Prompt Mode | Description |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `general-purpose` | all 7 | inherit | `append` (parent twin) | Inherits the parent's full system prompt — same rules, CLAUDE.md, project conventions |
| `Explore` | read, bash, grep, find, ls | haiku (falls back to inherit) | `replace` (standalone) | Fast codebase exploration (read-only) |
| `Plan` | read, bash, grep, find, ls | inherit | `replace` (standalone) | Software architect for implementation planning (read-only) |

The `general-purpose` agent is a **parent twin** — it receives the parent's entire system prompt plus a sub-agent context bridge, so it follows the same rules the parent does. Explore and Plan use standalone prompts tailored to their read-only roles.

Default agents can be **ejected** (`/agents` → select agent → Eject) to export them as `.md` files for customization, **overridden** by creating a `.md` file with the same name (e.g. `.pi/agents/general-purpose.md`), or **disabled** per-project with `enabled: false` frontmatter.

## Custom Agents

Define custom agent types by creating `.md` files. The frontmatter `name:` is the `subagent_type` and dispatch identity, falling back to the filename when absent; `display_name` only changes the UI label. Claiming a default agent's name overrides it.

Agents are discovered from three locations (higher priority wins):

| Priority | Location | Scope |
|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 (highest) | `.pi/agents/<name>.md` | Project — pi's config dir; authoritative, and where `/agents` writes |
| 2 | `.agents/agents/<name>.md` | Project — the shared cross-tool `.agents` workspace (same convention as `.agents/skills/`) |
| 3 | `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/agents/<name>.md` (default `~/.pi/agent/agents/<name>.md`) | Global — available everywhere |

Project-level agents override global ones with the same name, so you can customize a global agent for a specific project. If both project locations define the same name, **`.pi/agents/` wins** — `.pi` stays the project authority; `.agents/agents/` is an additional read location for projects that keep their agent assets in the `.agents` workspace. The global location follows the upstream `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` env var — set it to relocate all pi-coding-agent state (agents, skills, settings) to a custom directory. An agent's name is its frontmatter `name:`, falling back to the filename, so two files can now claim the same one — the later load wins, and the warning below names the file that took over.

An unreadable or unparseable agent file is skipped, not fatal — a warning names the file and the error. If it was overriding a same-named agent, a second line names the file that loads instead. Set `strictAgentFiles: true` in `subagents.json` (or `/agents → Settings → Strict agent files`) to fail startup on a broken file instead; mid-session reloads still only warn.

### Example: `.pi/agents/auditor.md`

```markdown
---
color: red
description: Security Code Reviewer
tools: read, grep, find, bash
model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
thinking: high
max_turns: 30
---

You are a security auditor. Review code for vulnerabilities including:
- Injection flaws (SQL, command, XSS)
- Authentication and authorization issues
- Sensitive data exposure
- Insecure configurations

Report findings with file paths, line numbers, severity, and remediation advice.
```

Then spawn it like any built-in type:

```
Agent({ subagent_type: "auditor", prompt: "Review the auth module", description: "Security audit" })
```

### Frontmatter Fields

All fields are optional — sensible defaults for everything.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `description` | filename | Agent description shown in tool listings |
| `name` | filename | **The agent's type** — what `subagent_type` and `@handle` address. Claude Code's rule: the filename doesn't have to match, so `blubb.md` with `name: code-review` dispatches as `code-review`. Omit it and the filename is used. Any value works except one containing `:`, which Claude Code reserves for plugin-scoped identifiers — such a file is skipped with a warning. Two files may declare the same name; the later load wins, as a filename clash always did |
| `display_name` | the type | Label shown in the UI (widget, agent list, badges) — cosmetic only, and independent of `name`. Claude Code has no equivalent; a file that sets only `name` badges as its type, unchanged |
| `color` | — | Background color for the agent name badge in the Agent tool header, widget, FleetView, and conversation viewer. Supports Claude Code's `red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `purple`, `orange`, `pink`, `cyan` (the values its own default theme uses); quoted six-digit hex such as `"#8B5CF6"`; and Agency Agents aliases (`amber`, `teal`, `indigo`, `gold`, `neon-green`, `neon-cyan`, `metallic-blue`, `violet`, `rose`, `lime`, `gray`/`grey`, `fuchsia`, `slate`, `navy`). Badge text is black or white, whichever clears 4.5:1 against the rendered background — Claude Code uses one inverse color for every badge. Invalid values render no badge and preserve each surface's existing theme foreground |
| `tools` | all 7 | Which tools the agent can call. Built-in names (`read, grep, …`), `*` / `all` (all built-ins), `none`, and `ext:<extension>` / `ext:<extension>/<tool>` selectors for extension tools. See [Tool & extension scoping](#tool--extension-scoping) below |
| `extensions` | `true` | Which extensions to load for the agent. `true` (all defaults), `false` (none), or an explicit list: `[mcp, "/abs/path.ts", "*"]`. See [Tool & extension scoping](#tool--extension-scoping) below |
| `exclude_extensions` | — | Extension denylist applied after `extensions:` — exclude wins. Plain names only (case-insensitive), no paths or `*`. Useful with `extensions: true` to drop one extension (e.g. `pi-notify`) |
| `skills` | `true` | `true` inherits the parent's skills; `false` inherits none. A comma-separated list preloads **only** those skills into the system prompt and does not inherit the rest (see [Skill Preloading](#skill-preloading) for discovery locations) |
| `memory` | — | Persistent agent memory scope: `project`, `local`, or `user`. Auto-detects read-only agents |
| `disallowed_tools` | — | Comma-separated tools to deny even if extensions provide them |
| `isolation` | — | Set to `worktree` to run in an isolated git worktree |
| `model` | inherit parent | Model — `provider/modelId` or fuzzy name (`"haiku"`, `"sonnet"`). Resolved tolerantly (`.`/`-` and a trailing date stamp are interchangeable) and falls back to the same model under another provider if the named one doesn't have it |
| `thinking` | inherit | off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max — actual availability depends on your pi version and model; pi clamps unsupported levels down |
| `max_turns` | unlimited | Max agentic turns before graceful shutdown. `0` or omit for unlimited |
| `persist_session` | `subagents.json` `rememberAgents` (default `true`) | Persist this subagent as a normal pi session instead of keeping the session in memory only; overrides the `rememberAgents` project default in both directions. It records its spawning session as parent, so it nests under it in `/resume`. The subagent's `.output` transcript is still written either way unless `output_transcript: false` |
| `output_transcript` | `true` (or `subagents.json` `outputTranscript`) | Write this subagent's `.output` transcript; when set, overrides the `subagents.json` `outputTranscript` default. Set `false` to write no transcript file or path. Governs only the transcript — independent of `persist_session`, `isolation: worktree`, and `memory:` |
| `session_dir` | pi default | Optional session directory when `persist_session: true`; omitted uses pi's normal session location, and relative paths resolve from the agent cwd. A session outside the parent's session directory (this override, or `isolation: worktree`) is listed separately, so it shows as a root instead of nesting |
| `allowed_subagents` | none | Opt in to scoped nested `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, and `steer_subagent` tools. Omitted / empty / `none` / `false` = no nesting; `all` (or `"*"` / `true`) = any enabled agent; comma-separated list = only those agent types |
| `prompt_mode` | `replace` | `replace`: body is the full system prompt (no AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md inheritance). `append`: body appended to parent's prompt (agent acts as a "parent twin" — inherits parent's AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md) |
| `inherit_context` | `false` | Fork parent conversation into agent |
| `run_in_background` | `false` | Run in background by default |
| `isolated` | `false` | Hermetic specialist mode: forces `extensions: false` + `skills: false` + drops `ext:` selectors. Only built-in tools. Distinct from `isolation: worktree` (filesystem) |
| `enabled` | `true` | Set to `false` to disable an agent (useful for hiding a default agent per-project) |

Frontmatter is authoritative. If an agent file sets `model`, `thinking`, `max_turns`, `inherit_context`, `run_in_background`, `isolated`, or `isolation`, those values are locked for that agent. `Agent` tool parameters only fill fields the agent config leaves unspecified.

**Forgiving `model:` resolution.** A `model:` pin is matched against pi's model registry tolerantly, so cosmetic id variations don't silently drop the agent back to the parent's model: `.` and `-` are treated as equivalent in version numbers (`claude-haiku-4.5` ≡ `claude-haiku-4-5`), a trailing `-YYYYMMDD` date stamp is optional (`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` matches an undated registry id and vice-versa), and a `provider/modelId` whose named provider doesn't carry that model retries the bare id against every provider. Precedence is **exact → fuzzy under the named provider → same model under any provider → unavailable**, so an exact match always wins and dated snapshots aren't conflated. If nothing resolves, the pin can't run and the agent inherits the parent model — `/agents → Agent types` flags this case as `(unavailable, fallback: inherit)` and shows the resolved target `(→ provider/id)` when resolution lands on a different provider or version than configured. (This is distinct from [Model Scope](#model-scope) enforcement, which matches the `enabledModels` allowlist by *exact* entry.)

### Nested subagents

Nested delegation is default-off. Set `allowed_subagents` only on a non-isolated custom agent that owns a real fan-out responsibility:

```yaml
---
tools: read, grep, find
extensions: false
allowed_subagents: support-file-finder, support-callsite-tracer   # or `all`
---
```

**The allowlist is a privilege boundary, not just a routing hint.** A child runs with *its own* `tools:`, `extensions:`, and `isolated:` — the parent's restrictions are not inherited — so delegation grants the parent the union of what the listed agents can do. The read-only agent above can write and run commands through any listed agent that can, and `all` reaches every enabled agent including `general-purpose`. Choose the list as carefully as you would choose `tools:` itself; that is the main reason this is default-off.

`allowed_subagents` is runtime-enforced. A comma-separated list restricts nesting to those types; `all` (or `"*"` / `true`, matching how `extensions:` and `skills:` take booleans) allows any enabled agent; omitted, empty, `none`, or `false` means no nested tools are injected at all. Unknown, disabled, and out-of-list types are rejected rather than falling back — regardless of the project's [fallback agent](#persistent-settings) setting, so a configured fallback can never hand a nested caller an agent outside its allowlist — and a nested `model:` is validated against [Model Scope](#model-scope) exactly like a top-level spawn. Result, resume, and steering operations are ownership-scoped, so a parent can control only its own children. Nested records remain internal to that parent and do not appear in top-level tools, lifecycle events, or agent UI — so when a parent finishes, is stopped, or ends a resumed turn, its nested children are stopped with it. They do write their own `.output` transcript (subject to the same `output_transcript` gate), filed under the root session's directory alongside their ancestors', so a nested run can still be inspected after the fact. Their token usage is folded into every ancestor's totals up to the top-level agent (lifecycle events, completion notifications, `/agents`), so nested spend stays attributable at any depth even though the children themselves stay hidden. A nested result that ends `stopped`, `aborted`, or `steered` is labelled as partial, the same guarantee top-level results carry.

The hard cap is depth 2 by default: main session (0) → subagent (1) → nested child (2). Change it project-wide with `maxSubagentDepth` in `subagents.json` (or `/agents → Settings → Nested depth`); `0` or `1` turns nesting off everywhere. An agent already at the cap gets no nested tools at all — not even `get_subagent_result`, since it can never own a child. A child must independently set `allowed_subagents` to delegate again; isolated agents never receive nested tools.

Nested children don't occupy `maxConcurrent` slots — their parent already holds one, and queueing them behind it would deadlock a parent waiting on its own child. The depth cap bounds how *deep* nesting goes, not how *wide*: a parent's only limit on concurrent children is that each spawn costs it a turn. Pair `allowed_subagents` with a `max_turns` on that agent if you want a hard ceiling on its fan-out.

Because a subagent session never activates this extension (that is what keeps a child from building a second agent manager, and it is why nested tools are injected directly instead), a subagent also gets none of the extension's other surfaces: no `/agents` command, no cross-extension RPC handlers, no `subagents:ready` event.

### Tool & extension scoping

`extensions:` decides **which extensions load**, `tools:` decides **which tools surface to the LLM**. They compose:

```yaml
# Default (both omitted): all extensions load, all 7 built-ins surface

tools: read, grep, find           # narrow to listed built-ins; extensions still load
tools: "*"                        # all 7 built-ins (alias: `all`)
tools: none                       # zero built-ins (alias: `""`)
tools: "*, ext:mcp/search"        # built-ins plus one extension tool

extensions: false                 # no extensions load
extensions: [mcp]                 # only mcp loads
extensions: ["*", "/abs/foo.ts"]  # all defaults plus one path-loaded extension

exclude_extensions: pi-notify     # everything except pi-notify (with extensions: true)

# Specialist: load one extension, expose only one of its tools, keep built-ins
extensions: [mcp]
tools: "*, ext:mcp/search"

isolated: true                    # hermetic: built-ins only, no extensions/skills/context
```

A few rules the examples don't make obvious:

- `extensions:` is the sole loading authority. `ext:foo` in `tools:` narrows what surfaces; it can't load `foo` on its own. Mismatches fire `extension-error:…` warnings.
- Any `ext:` entry flips extension tools to an explicit allowlist — unnamed extensions still load (handlers fire) but expose no tools. So `tools: "*, ext:mcp/search"` exposes only `search` from `mcp`, nothing from any other extension.
- Extension names match case-insensitively (`[Mcp]` = `[mcp]`); tool names in `ext:foo/bar` stay case-sensitive.
- Extensions that register tools **lazily** work too. MCP-backed extensions typically can't enumerate their tools until their servers connect, so they register from `session_start` or `before_agent_start` rather than at load. Subagent scoping is re-derived as tools appear, so these surface normally — including under `ext:` selectors, which keep narrowing correctly no matter when a tool shows up.
- An installed **package** extension matches by its package short name (`@scope/pi-subagents` → `[pi-subagents]`), in addition to its path-derived name (a package whose entry is `src/index.ts` also answers to `[src]`). Prefer the package name — the path-derived one is incidental.
- Plain `tools:` typos fail loudly: `tools: reed, grep` fires `tools-error:…` instead of silently producing an under-tooled agent.
- `exclude_extensions:` wins over `extensions:` and over `ext:` selectors — an excluded extension never loads and a `tools: ext:` entry can't pull it back. Plain names only (no paths, no `*`); a name matching nothing fires an `extension-error:…` warning.
- `exclude_extensions:` is **not a sandbox**: excluded extensions' factory code still executes once during loading. Exclusion suppresses their tools and their bound lifecycle hooks (`pi.on` handlers like `session_start` only fire for extensions bound to the session), but not other load-time side effects — a factory that subscribes directly to the shared `pi.events` bus stays live. Don't rely on it to contain an untrusted extension.
- Array and string forms are equivalent: `[a, b]` == `"a, b"`.

**How an agent's scope is advertised.** The Agent tool description lists every available agent with a `(Tools: …)` suffix, and that suffix is what the orchestrator reads when deciding where to route work. It describes **built-in scope only** — extension tools are resolved when the agent runs (extensions may register lazily, see above), so they can't be enumerated when the description is built:

| `tools:` | suffix |
|---|---|
| omitted, `*`, or `all` | `*` |
| a list of built-ins | that list, e.g. `read, grep` |
| `none` with `isolated: true` or `extensions: false` | `none` |
| `none`, or only `ext:` entries, with extensions loading | `no built-ins, extension tools only` |

The last two rows are separate because zero built-ins is not zero tools: `tools: none` alongside `extensions:` still surfaces every extension tool, so calling it `none` would understate what the agent can do. Note `*` doesn't enumerate extension tools either — an agent with `tools: "*, ext:mcp/search"` advertises `*`.

## Tools

### `Agent`

Launch a sub-agent.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `prompt` | string | yes | The task for the agent |
| `description` | string | yes | Short 3-5 word summary (shown in UI) |
| `name` | string | no | Memorable name for this agent (`auth-audit`), addressable as `@name` and accepted by `steer_subagent`/`get_subagent_result`. Additive — the type-derived handle is still assigned |
| `subagent_type` | string | yes | Agent type (built-in or custom) |
| `model` | string | no | Model — `provider/modelId` or fuzzy name (`"haiku"`, `"sonnet"`). Resolved tolerantly (`.`/`-` and a trailing date stamp interchangeable) with provider fallback |
| `thinking` | string | no | Thinking level: off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max (availability depends on pi version and model) |
| `max_turns` | number | no | Max agentic turns. Omit for unlimited (default) |
| `run_in_background` | boolean | no | Run without blocking |
| `resume` | string | no | Agent ID to resume a previous session |
| `isolated` | boolean | no | No extension/MCP tools |
| `isolation` | `"worktree"` | no | Run in an isolated git worktree |
| `inherit_context` | boolean | no | Fork parent conversation into agent |

### `get_subagent_result`

Check status and retrieve results from a background agent.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_id` | string | yes | Agent ID to check |
| `wait` | boolean | no | Wait for completion |
| `verbose` | boolean | no | Include full conversation log |

Cancelling a `wait: true` call (for example, with `Esc`) stops only the wait. The background agent keeps running, and its completion notification still arrives normally.

### `steer_subagent`

Send a steering message to a running agent. The message interrupts after the current tool execution.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_id` | string | yes | Agent ID to steer |
| `message` | string | yes | Message to inject into agent conversation |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/agents` | Interactive agent management menu |

The `/agents` command opens an interactive menu:

```
Running agents (2) — 1 running, 1 done     ← only shown when agents exist
Agent types (6)                             ← unified list: defaults + custom
Create new agent                            ← manual wizard or AI-generated
Settings                                    ← max concurrency, max turns, grace turns, join mode
```

- **Running agents** — select one to open its live conversation viewer. While it's still running, press `Enter` to open the steering composer, then `Enter` again to send a message that redirects the agent (same mechanism as the `steer_subagent` tool; `Esc` or an empty submit returns), or press `x` (then `x` again to confirm) to stop/abort it — including **background** agents, which a global Esc can't unambiguously target (Esc still stops a blocking foreground `Agent` call). A stopped agent reports its partial output flagged as incomplete, not as a completion.
- **Agent types** — unified list with source indicators: `•` (project), `◦` (global), `✕` (disabled). Each row shows the agent's model, and the highlighted agent's full description appears below the list. The model column flags `(unavailable, fallback: inherit)` when a configured model can't be resolved (it would silently inherit the parent model), and shows `(→ provider/id)` when it resolves to a different provider or version than configured. Select an agent to manage it:
  - **Default agents** (no override): Eject (export as `.md`), Disable
  - **Default agents** (ejected/overridden): Edit, Disable, Reset to default, Delete
  - **Custom agents**: Edit, Disable, Delete
  - **Disabled agents**: Enable, Edit, Delete
- **Eject** — writes the embedded default config as a `.md` file to project or personal location, so you can customize it
- **Disable/Enable** — toggle agent availability. Disabled agents stay visible in the list (marked `✕`) and can be re-enabled
- **Create new agent** — choose project/personal location, then manual wizard (step-by-step prompts for name, tools, model, thinking, system prompt) or AI-generated (describe what the agent should do and a sub-agent writes the `.md` file). Any name is allowed, including default agent names (overrides them)
- **Settings** — configure max concurrency, default max turns, grace turns, and join mode at runtime

## Graceful Max Turns

Instead of hard-aborting at the turn limit, agents get a graceful shutdown:

1. At `max_turns` — steering message: *"Wrap up immediately — provide your final answer now."*
2. Up to 5 grace turns to finish cleanly
3. Hard abort only after the grace period

| Status | Meaning | Icon |
|--------|---------|------|
| `completed` | Finished naturally | `✓` green |
| `steered` | Hit limit, wrapped up in time | `✓` yellow |
| `aborted` | Grace period exceeded | `✗` red |
| `stopped` | User-initiated abort | `■` dim |

## Concurrency

Background agents are subject to a configurable concurrency limit (default: 4). Excess agents are automatically queued and start as running agents complete. The widget shows queued agents as a collapsed count.

Foreground agents bypass the queue — they block the parent anyway.

## Join Strategies

When background agents complete, they notify the main agent. The **join mode** controls how these notifications are delivered. It applies only to background agents.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `smart` (default) | 2+ background agents spawned in the same turn are auto-grouped into a single consolidated notification. Solo agents notify individually. |
| `async` | Each agent sends its own notification on completion (original behavior). Best when results need incremental processing. |
| `group` | Force grouping even when spawning a single agent. Useful when you know more agents will follow. |

**Timeout behavior:** When agents are grouped, a 30-second timeout starts after the first agent completes. If not all agents finish in time, a partial notification is sent with completed results and remaining agents continue with a shorter 15-second re-batch window for stragglers.

**Configuration:**
- Configure join mode in `/agents` → Settings → Join mode

## Model Scope

**Opt-in:** off by default. Enable via `/agents → Settings → Scope models`.

When on, each subagent spawn's effective model is validated against pi's own `enabledModels` list (configured via pi's `/scoped-models` UI). pi-subagents reads that list; it doesn't manage it. Both of pi's settings files are honored: global `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` and project-local `<cwd>/.pi/settings.json`. **Project overrides global** — mirrors pi's `SettingsManager` deep-merge, so a tighter per-project scope (hand-edited into the project settings) is respected.

**Out-of-scope handling depends on source:**

| Model source | Out-of-scope behavior |
|---|---|
| Caller-supplied via `Agent({ model: "..." })` | Hard error returned to the orchestrator, listing allowed models |
| Pinned in agent frontmatter | Warning toast + the pinned model runs (frontmatter is authoritative) |
| Parent-inherited (neither set) | Warning toast + parent's model runs |

**Design:** `scopeModels` is a guardrail against the orchestrator picking unexpected models at runtime, not a hard policy against user-level config. The "frontmatter is authoritative" guarantee from v0.5.1 still holds for `model:` — caller params can't override frontmatter, and frontmatter pins run even when out of scope (with a visible warning).

**Nested spawns** ([nested subagents](#nested-subagents)) apply the same table against the parent's config root. The hard-error case is identical; the warning cases proceed silently, since a subagent session has no UI to toast to.

**Pattern format:** only exact `provider/modelId` entries are honored (e.g. `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`). Glob patterns (`*sonnet*`), bare model IDs, and `:thinking` suffixes — which pi itself supports — are silently dropped here. pi's `/scoped-models` picker writes exact entries, so the limitation is invisible if you configure scope through the UI. Hand-edited globs produce an empty allowed set (scope check becomes a no-op).

**No-op safety:** if `enabledModels` is missing or empty in pi's settings, scope check skips entirely — no false positives, no spurious errors.

## Persistent Settings

Runtime tuning values set via `/agents` → Settings (max concurrency, default max turns, grace turns, nested depth, fallback agent, default join mode, scheduling on/off, scope models on/off, disable defaults on/off, strict agent files on/off, agent mentions on/off, output transcript on/off, tool description full/compact/custom, widget all/background/off) persist across pi restarts. Two files, merged on load:

- **Global:** `~/.pi/agent/subagents.json` — your machine-wide defaults. Edit by hand; the `/agents` menu never writes here.
- **Project:** `<cwd>/.pi/subagents.json` — per-project overrides. Written by `/agents` → Settings.

**Precedence:** project overrides global on any field present in both. Missing fields fall back to the hardcoded defaults (max concurrency `4`, default max turns unlimited, grace turns `5`, nested depth `2`, join mode `smart`, defaults enabled).

**Nested depth** (`maxSubagentDepth`, default `2`): the hard ceiling on [nested delegation](#nested-subagents), counted from the main session (main = 0, its subagents = 1). `0` or `1` disables nesting project-wide regardless of any agent's `allowed_subagents`. Read when a subagent session is built, so a change applies to agents started after it.

**Fallback agent** (`fallbackSubagent`, default `general-purpose`): the agent used when a caller-supplied `subagent_type` doesn't resolve to exactly one enabled agent — unknown, disabled, or ambiguous because two agents differ only by case. Name any enabled agent to route those calls there instead, or set `none` for **strict**, fail-closed dispatch: the call is refused with an error listing the available types, and nothing spawns. Strict mode matters most for background and scheduled calls, which would otherwise start executing a substituted agent before the caller learns anything. Also settable from `/agents → Settings → Fallback agent`. The boolean `false` is accepted as a spelling of `none`, because it would otherwise be dropped as the wrong type and silently leave the permissive default in place. Every other value is read as an agent name, so a mistaken `off` fails loudly at dispatch rather than meaning one thing in the settings file and another in the resolver. A fallback agent that is itself unknown or disabled is a misconfiguration and is reported rather than quietly replaced. Note the default is unchanged and stays permissive by design: with `disableDefaultAgents` and no `general-purpose` of your own, an unresolvable type still resolves to a built-in config carrying *all* tools — set `none` (or name one of your own agents) to close that.

**Strict agent files** (`strictAgentFiles`, default `false`): when on, an unreadable or unparseable [agent file](#custom-agents) aborts extension load at startup and names the file, instead of being skipped with a warning — so a checked-in `.pi/agents/` can't silently fall through to a same-named agent from another location. Startup only: the mid-session reload that runs on each `Agent` call keeps warning either way, since a bad edit shouldn't kill a session on an unrelated spawn. Also settable from `/agents → Settings → Strict agent files`.

**Disable defaults** (`disableDefaultAgents`, default `false`): when on, the three built-in agents (general-purpose, Explore, Plan) are not registered — only your project/global custom agents are advertised and spawnable. User-defined agents are unaffected, including ones that override a default by name. The Agent tool's type list updates on the next pi session (the tool schema is registered at startup).

**Agent mentions** (`agentMentions`, default `"model"`): whether [`@handle message`](#agent-mentions) at the prompt addresses that subagent instead of the main model — messaging, resuming or starting it — and whether `@` offers agents alongside pi's file completion. `"model"` and `"direct"` differ only in [who starts an agent that isn't running](#starting-a-new-agent): an off-screen clone of this conversation, via a `<system-reminder>` and a real `Agent` call, or this extension, immediately and with no model call. Messaging and resuming are direct in both. `"off"` gates all three actions plus the suggestion list, so `@` means only "attach a file" again and every `@…` prompt reaches the main model verbatim. Toggle via `/agents → Settings → Agent mentions`; applied live. The booleans this setting used to take are still read — `true` as `"model"`, `false` as `"off"`.

**Remember agents** (`rememberAgents`, default `true`): whether subagents persist their pi session, which is what lets [`@handle`](#agent-mentions) reopen an agent's conversation after its in-memory record has been evicted. Two visible consequences of the default: top-level subagents write a session file, and they nest under the session that spawned them in pi's `/resume`. Agents spawned by another agent are excluded — they get no handle, so nothing could reopen their transcript. A custom agent's `persist_session` frontmatter overrides this per agent, in both directions. Toggle via `/agents → Settings → Remember agents`; with it off, handles expire with their record (roughly ten minutes past completion) and `@explore` then starts a fresh agent rather than resuming — the behaviour before this setting existed.

**Output transcript** (`outputTranscript`, default `true`): the project/global default for writing each subagent's `.output` transcript. Toggle via `/agents → Settings → Output transcript`, or set `false` in `subagents.json` to make transcripts opt-in project-wide — useful when run transcripts shouldn't sit on disk for backup or DLP tooling to pick up. A custom agent's `output_transcript` frontmatter overrides this per agent. Applied live at spawn time. Governs only the transcript, not `persist_session`, worktree commits, or memory files.

**Tool description** (`toolDescriptionMode`, default `"full"`): which Agent tool description the LLM sees. `"full"` is the rich Claude Code-style prompt (~1,400 tokens with the default agents); `"compact"` is ~75% smaller — one-line agent type list, terse usage notes — for small/local models where tool-spec tokens are expensive. Per-option details stay in the parameter descriptions in every mode (the parameter schema is never customizable). Applies on the next pi session.

`"custom"` registers your own description from `<cwd>/.pi/agent-tool-description.md` (project) or `<agentDir>/agent-tool-description.md` (global; project wins). The file is read once at tool registration, so edits also apply on the next pi session. Dynamic parts stay live via placeholders — a static agent list would go stale the moment you add a custom agent:

```markdown
Launch an autonomous agent. Available types:
{{typeList}}

Custom agents live in .pi/agents/ or {{agentDir}}/agents/.
```

Placeholders: `{{typeList}}` (full per-agent descriptions), `{{compactTypeList}}` (first sentence each), `{{agentDir}}`, `{{scheduleGuideline}}` (expands with its own leading newline + `- ` bullet when scheduling is on — place it directly after your last rule line; empty when scheduling is off). Unknown placeholders are left verbatim with a stderr warning; a missing or empty file falls back to `"full"` with a warning. Note the usual trust umbrella: a project-level file shapes the orchestrator's prompt, same as project agents and extensions do.

**Starting point:** copy [`examples/agent-tool-description.md`](examples/agent-tool-description.md) — it reproduces the default full description exactly (a CI test keeps it in sync), so you can trim from a known-good baseline instead of writing from scratch.

**Example — global defaults for a beefy machine:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent
cat > ~/.pi/agent/subagents.json <<'EOF'
{
  "maxConcurrent": 16,
  "graceTurns": 10
}
EOF
```

Every project now starts with concurrency 16 and grace 10, without ever touching the menu. Individual projects can still override via `/agents` → Settings.

**Failure behavior:** missing file is silent; malformed JSON logs a `[pi-subagents] Ignoring malformed settings at …` warning to stderr; invalid/out-of-range field values are dropped per-field; write failures downgrade the `/agents` toast to a warning with `(session only; failed to persist)`.

## Events

Agent lifecycle events are emitted via `pi.events.emit()` so other extensions can react:

| Event | When | Key fields |
|-------|------|------------|
| `subagents:created` | Background agent registered | `id`, `type`, `description`, `isBackground` |
| `subagents:started` | Agent transitions to running (including queued→running) | `id`, `type`, `description` |
| `subagents:completed` | Agent finished successfully (background and foreground) | `id`, `type`, `durationMs`, `tokens` (lifetime `{ input, output, total }`), `toolUses`, `result` |
| `subagents:failed` | Agent errored, stopped, or aborted (background and foreground) | same as completed + `error`, `status` |
| `subagents:steered` | Steering message sent | `id`, `message` |
| `subagents:compacted` | Agent's session successfully compacted | `id`, `type`, `description`, `reason` (`"manual"` / `"threshold"` / `"overflow"`), `tokensBefore`, `compactionCount` |
| `subagents:scheduled` | Schedule lifecycle change | `{ type: "added" \| "removed" \| "updated" \| "fired" \| "error", … }` (job/agentId/error fields per type) |
| `subagents:scheduler_ready` | Scheduler bound to session, enabled jobs armed | `sessionId`, `jobCount` |
| `subagents:ready` | RPC handlers registered and armed — fired on session start; not emitted in a session that excludes pi-subagents | — |
| `subagents:settings_loaded` | Persisted settings applied at extension init | `settings` (merged global + project) |
| `subagents:settings_changed` | `/agents` → Settings mutation was applied | `settings`, `persisted` (`boolean` — `false` on write failure) |

`tokens.total` = `input + output + cacheWrite`. `cacheRead` is excluded — each turn's `cacheRead` is the cumulative cached prefix re-read on that one API call, so summing per-message would over-count it. Use `contextUsage.percent` (surfaced as `(NN%)` in the widget) for current context size.

## Cross-Extension RPC

Other pi extensions can spawn and stop subagents programmatically via the `pi.events` event bus, without importing this package directly.

All RPC replies use a standardized envelope: `{ success: true, data?: T }` on success, `{ success: false, error: string }` on failure.

### Discovery

Listen for `subagents:ready` to know when RPC handlers are available:

```typescript
pi.events.on("subagents:ready", () => {
  // RPC handlers are registered — safe to call ping/spawn/stop
});
```

`subagents:ready` fires only when pi-subagents is actually loaded **and bound** in the current session. A session that excludes it (via an agent's `extensions:`) emits no `subagents:ready` and does not answer the RPC channels — exactly as if pi-subagents were not installed. Treat "no `subagents:ready`" as "not available here" and give discovery a timeout rather than waiting indefinitely.

### Ping

Check if the subagents extension is loaded and get the protocol version:

```typescript
const requestId = crypto.randomUUID();
const unsub = pi.events.on(`subagents:rpc:ping:reply:${requestId}`, (reply) => {
  unsub();
  if (reply.success) console.log("Protocol version:", reply.data.version);
});
pi.events.emit("subagents:rpc:ping", { requestId });
```

### Spawn

Spawn a subagent and receive its ID:

```typescript
const requestId = crypto.randomUUID();
const unsub = pi.events.on(`subagents:rpc:spawn:reply:${requestId}`, (reply) => {
  unsub();
  if (!reply.success) {
    console.error("Spawn failed:", reply.error);
  } else {
    console.log("Agent ID:", reply.data.id);
  }
});
pi.events.emit("subagents:rpc:spawn", {
  requestId,
  type: "general-purpose",
  prompt: "Do something useful",
  options: { description: "My task", isBackground: true },
});
```

`options` is the manager's spawn-option object, not the `Agent` tool's parameter schema — the background flag is `isBackground`, and the tool's snake_case `run_in_background` is forwarded verbatim and ignored. Every RPC spawn returns its id immediately and runs detached either way; `isBackground: true` is what makes the agent occupy one of the `maxConcurrent` slots (and queue behind them when they are full) and what `subagents:created` reports. Leaving it unset starts the agent immediately regardless of the limit. A top-level RPC spawn renders in the widget and FleetView while it runs — only an explicit `isBackground: false` is dropped by the widget's default `background` mode, the way a foreground `Agent` call is. Nested spawns stay hidden from both.

`options.model` accepts either a `Model` object (e.g. `ctx.model`) or a `"provider/modelId"` string — strings are resolved against `ctx.modelRegistry` at the RPC boundary, so cross-extension callers can forward serializable values without losing auth context.

`options.cwd` (absolute path to an existing directory — anything else returns an error envelope; `null` means unset) runs the agent in a different working directory than the parent session. Its tools operate there and the prompt's environment block describes it, but **`.pi` config still loads from the parent session's project** — the target directory's `.pi` extensions never execute, and its agents/skills/settings are not picked up. Combined with `isolation: "worktree"`, the worktree is created *from* the target directory's repo, the agent works at the equivalent subdirectory inside the copy (a monorepo-package cwd stays scoped to that package), and the resulting `pi-agent-*` branch lands in that repo — the completion message names it. On session end, worktree registrations are pruned in every repo that received one; only a hard crash can leave a stale entry (then: `git worktree prune` in the target repo). Agents with `memory:` keep reading/writing the parent project's memory.

### Stop

Stop a running agent by ID:

```typescript
const requestId = crypto.randomUUID();
const unsub = pi.events.on(`subagents:rpc:stop:reply:${requestId}`, (reply) => {
  unsub();
  if (!reply.success) console.error("Stop failed:", reply.error);
});
pi.events.emit("subagents:rpc:stop", { requestId, agentId: "agent-id-here" });
```

Reply channels are scoped per `requestId`, so concurrent requests don't interfere.

## Persistent Agent Memory

Agents can have persistent memory across sessions. Set `memory` in frontmatter to enable:

```yaml
---
memory: project   # project | local | user
---
```

| Scope | Location | Use case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `project` | `.pi/agent-memory/<name>/` | Shared across the team (committed) |
| `local` | `.pi/agent-memory-local/<name>/` | Machine-specific (gitignored) |
| `user` | `<agentDir>/agent-memory/<name>/` (default `~/.pi/agent/agent-memory/`, honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) | Global personal memory |

The `user` scope previously hardcoded `~/.pi/agent-memory/`. If that legacy directory exists for an agent and the new location doesn't, it keeps being used — existing memories aren't orphaned.

Memory uses a `MEMORY.md` index file and individual memory files with frontmatter. Agents with write tools get full read-write access. **Read-only agents** (no `write`/`edit` tools) automatically get read-only memory — they can consume memories written by other agents but cannot modify them. This prevents unintended tool escalation.

The `disallowed_tools` field is respected when determining write capability — an agent with `tools: write` + `disallowed_tools: write` correctly gets read-only memory.

## Worktree Isolation

Set `isolation: worktree` to run an agent in a temporary git worktree:

```
Agent({ subagent_type: "refactor", prompt: "...", isolation: "worktree" })
```

The agent gets a full, isolated copy of the repository. On completion:
- **No changes:** worktree is cleaned up automatically
- **Changes made:** changes are committed to a new branch (`pi-agent-<id>`) and returned in the result
- **Agent committed its own work:** the branch is created at the agent's HEAD, preserving its commits (uncommitted leftovers are committed on top first)

The agent's system prompt names the worktree as an isolated copy and tells it to work only there, even if other instructions name the main checkout — otherwise an inherited parent prompt or a task prompt mentioning the project path walks it straight back out of the copy. This is a directive, not a sandbox: an agent with shell access can still `cd` out, so don't rely on `isolation` alone to protect the main checkout.

The automatic preservation commit uses `--no-verify`, so local pre-commit hooks can't block it — the commit is local-only and never pushed, and pre-push/server-side hooks still apply.

If the worktree cannot be created (not a git repo, no commits, or `git worktree add` fails), the `Agent` call fails with a clear error instead of running unisolated — `isolation: "worktree"` is a strict guarantee, not a hint. The call is reported as a failed tool call, not as a subagent that ran and returned that message, so the model doesn't retry it as if the agent had merely reported a problem. Initialize git and commit at least once, or omit `isolation`.

## Skill Preloading

Skills can be preloaded by name and injected into the agent's system prompt:

```yaml
---
skills: api-conventions, error-handling
---
```

**Discovery roots** (checked in this order, first match wins):

| Scope | Path | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Project | `<cwd>/.pi/skills/` | Pi-standard |
| Project | `<cwd>/.agents/skills/` | [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills) |
| User | `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/skills/` (default `~/.pi/agent/skills/`) | Pi-standard |
| User | `~/.agents/skills/` | [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills) |
| User | `~/.pi/skills/` | Legacy (pre-Pi) |

**Per root, a skill named `foo` resolves to the first of:**

- `<root>/foo.md` — flat file at the top level
- `<root>/foo/SKILL.md` — directory skill (top-level)
- `<root>/*/.../foo/SKILL.md` — directory skill, found by recursive descent

Recursion skips dotfile directories and `node_modules`. A directory that itself contains a `SKILL.md` is treated as a single skill — we don't descend into it. Traversal is byte-order sorted for deterministic resolution across filesystems.

**Security:** symlinks are rejected at every layer (root, flat file, skill directory, `SKILL.md` inside a skill directory) — intentional deviation from Pi, which follows symlinks. Skill names with path-traversal characters (`..`, `/`, `\`, spaces, leading dot, >128 chars) are rejected.

## Tool Denylist

Block specific tools from an agent even if extensions provide them:

```yaml
---
tools: read, bash, grep, write
disallowed_tools: write, edit
---
```

This is useful for creating agents that inherit extension tools but should not have write access.
