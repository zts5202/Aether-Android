/**
 * agent-mention.ts — what `@` can address, and the suggestions pi renders for it.
 *
 * A subagent is addressable whether or not it is currently running: a live
 * record is messaged or resumed, an evicted one whose session is still on disk
 * is reopened, and an agent *type* with no instance at all is started. That is
 * the point of the handle — `@explore` means the Explore agent, not "the
 * Explore process that happens to exist right now" — so the roster below unions
 * all three, and the dispatcher and the popup read the same list.
 *
 * Rows are per *agent*, not per handle. An agent given a `name` holds two names
 * (its alias and its type-derived handle) and both resolve, but it lists once,
 * under the alias, with its type moved into the description so the row still
 * says what it is.
 *
 * pi's `CombinedAutocompleteProvider` already owns `@`, where it means "attach a
 * file". Extensions can wrap it (`ctx.ui.addAutocompleteProvider`), so this
 * provider answers the `@` tokens that name an agent and delegates every other
 * one — including all of `applyCompletion`, whose `@`-branch already inserts
 * `item.value` plus a trailing space, which is exactly what a handle needs.
 *
 * Matching mirrors Claude Code: case-insensitive prefix (not fuzzy), and when
 * any agent matches, files are dropped from the list rather than mixed in — an
 * `@name` that names an agent is never also a path. Offering never-started
 * types is a deliberate step beyond it; Claude Code's registry holds only live
 * tasks, so an agent you had not launched yet was unaddressable.
